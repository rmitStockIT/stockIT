    <h3>Ahmet Akgun</h3>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>The first thing I noticed about our team is it was formed soon after the group assignments were released. A team with with initiative has an early start and has extra time for their overall work. This  advantage allowed the team members to resolve any complication that occurred during the study period.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>Our team communicated swiftly on Microsoft Teams and every member was notified immediately for the updates. Some group meetings exceeded the allocated time mark and caused minor distractions. This resulted in the misalignment of some of our tasks. Though, it was corrected quickly.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>On a few occasions, our meetings clashed with my meetings with another team from another subject. My Intro to IT team was kind enough to schedule the time of our periodic meetings to a more convenient point and any collision was avoided.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>In the early phases of our project, I’ve found some of our discussions longer than expected but towards the next phases of our task they proved to be quite explanatory and beneficial. </i></p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <h3>Brandon McPherson</h3>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>After completing Assessment 2, there were definitely some fatigue within the group. We were eager to get our results back for Assessment 2 as we put a lot of work in for the assignment but also needed our feedback to see if we were going in right direction for our project. </i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>For our first meeting, Taylen nominated himself as the project leader for assessments 3 and 5, allowing Tetsu to focus his efforts on the video presentation for assessment 5. I was tasked to create a script for Assessment 5 which I found a little daunting. This was because I had to imagine how the video was going to structured even though I wasn’t tasked to create the video presentation. I didn’t know if the script was going to make sense but after seeing the video draft that Tetsu put together, there was a feeling of relief. It was great to see how well the video went based off the structure of the script and seeing everything come together. Through the assessment, I had to go back between Assessments 3 and 5 to do bits of work. At times I was worried as there were so many components to get through but as we were nearing the submission date, you could see the assessments all coming together. </i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>Through my group work in this course unit for introduction to information technology, I have learnt how important it is to set small tasks and put time aside each day to complete them. </i></p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <h3>Hugo Hughes</h3>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>There was definitely a large degree of fatigue after completing Assignment Two; however despite this the group was keen to capitalise on our strong performance and deliver equally strong end result for assignments 3 & 5. Taylen put his hand up for the manager role this time round and was effective in keeping us on topic and focussed. Ahmet drove contributions for tools & technologies, whilst Brandon and Tetsu did a fantastic job taking lead of the script and video components of the assignment. I mainly worked closely with Tim trying to take onboard the feedback we received from Assignment 2 to refine our wording, delivery and scope for Assignment 3. I really enjoyed leveraging off all of our different skills and experiences. As a group we work well together and I feel very lucky to have found this team to do my first IT course with!</i></p>

    <h3>Taylen Anderson</h3>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>From humble beginnings, our team started from a few individuals in an IT class. We have developed our project from week four until now with great effect. In our time together we have overcome a few challenges such as hardware failures, and pulled together to finish our work to a high standard. Continuing with this assignment I have learnt a lot from each of our team members either from research to answer questions they had or directly from them individually. Hugo surprised me with his structured writing and deep understanding of marketing and its importance in not just selling a product but also yourself. Business was a topic that a particularly had troubles with though speaking off hours with both Tetsu and Timothy I have definitely expanded my knowledge and confidence with that field. Brandon was another surprising individual moving from strength to strength, initially coming to our group as one of the quietest, he drafted the majority of our video pitch and contributed a significant amount of voice recording to make our video idea a reality. Finally, though not of least we have Ahmet, He was able to contribute more within the confines of this assignment, with both some interesting ideas on which software and languages we could use to accomplish our Theoretical goals. In summary I am very privileged to have been invited to join this group and thrilled to have participated in this task.</i></p>

    <h3>Tetsu Watanabe</h3>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>I believe that I was assigned to one of the best teams within the entire course. Despite my initial concern at the beginning of assessment 1, we have experienced no major issue with the group collaboration until to date. I believe that we did very well developing a degree of trust in each other.  Taylen, our group leader, was very effective in managing the team. Thanks to him, our biweekly meeting became exceptionally effective and efficient. Tim and Hugo surprised me for their continued dedication to the project plan despite the fatigue we experienced after our busy schedule of completing assignment 2. After successfully completing the IT work interview in assignment 2, Brandon again showed his storytelling talent by creating well-written scripts for our video presentation. Ahmet, a keen music editor, was always willing to help me with the sound effect of our video presentation.  </i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>It was a pleasant experience to realise that group work could be an easy mission when everyone is willing to collaborate.  My attempt with this course could have been much harder if I had been assigned to a different team. There may be some improvements to be made, such as completing each task a little quicker, but overall, we did very well. From my experience, I can say that it is even hard to find a team like us in a real business. So, all I have is respect for my team.</i></p>
  </div>

    <h3>Tim Prast</h3>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>While our group worked its way through Assignment 2, we were keenly aware of the upcoming tasks in Assignment 3 and 5 and tried to get as much information into and about our project (stockIT) into Assignment 2 as we could. This was a great idea at the time, however there was a great amount of fatigue felt by both myself and the rest of the group when we needed to now write into further (although mostly previously covered) detail about stockIT and its business landscape. </i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>With Assignments 3 and 5 I have really enjoyed that the awkward first assignment interactions were done and out of the way, it meant that we could roll into the next two assignments as a very unified group that was entirely aware of how each member worked, their capacities and their skills sets. It has also allowed us to facilitate very effective and efficient smaller group tasks, allowing each of us to work to our strengths. </i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>Taylen did an amazing job at setting the pace and structure of the next assignments as well as a firm guiding hand in making sure we all got through the fatigue and got our tasks submitted but also allowing and allocating some unofficial time for us all to chat and hang out. Ahmet did well with the tools&tech section and has been much more engaged in our meetings. Tetsu and Brandon both outdid themselves by taking the lead on the scripting and creation of our groups presentation video, I’ve definitely shared the video to a few friends and I think it highlights our groups personality very well. Hugo and I worked closely on a number of aspects of this assignment and I feel I’ve learnt a lot from his during our exchanges.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="Yellow"><i>Overall, I couldn’t be more happy with Group 12 and my experiences. A group of 6 strangers from the internet have managed to come together a create a project idea with a real world business application, one which we could immediately continue working on and look at launching. </i></p>
