  <h3>Group Processes</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="white">
    <p>In assignment two our team was quite fresh at learning to work together. This was particularly evidenced by our initial meetings lack of structure and leadership. Progress through assignment two transitioned us from no management to a central leader (Tetsu Watanabe) from whom everyone else answered to. This was a significant step and produced some sizeable benefits in terms of productivity and reduced wasted time drastically.</p></br>
    <p>Progression to assignment three our team has kept with the same arrangement under a new leader (Taylen Anderson). Small changes implemented include things such as individuals in a meeting being required to mute themselves during each meeting unless they are called upon by the host. Assignment three has also attempted to move our group to a GitHub from the beginning approach allowing collaboration for individual segments of our assignment to be completed easily by multiple parties. This team dynamic is a natural progression from where we were in assignment two and should allow us to continue to build on that foundation.</p></br>

<h3>Career Plans</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="white">
    <p>Our team have an impressive variety of ideal jobs. This culminates with a large variety of careers available for us as individuals from the public sector as a teacher, to the private sector as a computer engineer. This is just a snippet of the available roles available within the Information Technology (IT) industry however we will go further in depth to see what variety is available to us.</p></br>
    <p>Ahmet Akgun wishes to become a teacher within the industry. This contrasts with our team in many ways, for example this was the only job to specifically require a masters degree in any field. Additionally there are requirements for skills in teaching as well as communication. Due to the nature of this particular industry the communication skill would have different assessment criteria to communication in a management position. Teaching within the IT industry will likely have many interesting challenges and is going to be a role on the outskirts of the industry in an intriguing way.</p></br>
    <p>Brandon McPherson indicated he would like to be a full stack developer. The role included within his first assignment (Full Stack Developer, BHP) asks for significant experience in application development using a lot more programming languages not intended for web development. BHP requires significant knowledge using Linux systems and creating and using a virtualisation software known as Docker. This contrasts significantly with the other member of our group also wishing to be a full stack developer Tetsu Watanabe. A full stack developer at BHP is very different to a full stack developer somewhere else.</p></br>
    <p>Hugo Hughes told us that he would like be a Cyber Security Technical Officer. The specific position which Hugo provided is with the Australian Military, this would likely lead to different requirements than the same position in the public sector. Interestingly this position requests developed artefacts in communication skills and analytical skills, this is to allow the individual to educate other individuals within the company structure. This is interesting in contrast to Cyber security roles located in the private sector which generally put more of an emphasis on the security hardware than the people using it.</p></br>
    <p>Taylen Anderson chose this position within the firmware engineering segment of IT. This was an interesting choice as it lead into not only development of software but also hardware which was not common with the others in our team. There was a high level of programming skills required with languages including c, c++ and java. The languages requested do have some crossover into the software development segments of the it industry though this is becoming less and less frequent. This job also requested knowledge in basic electronics with measurement of current, resistance and noise being noted as important. As such it seems that firmware engineering is another special category within the information technology industry to be exploited.</p></br>
    <p>Tetsu Watanabe chose the position of full stack developer along with Brandon. Though the position title was the same the actual jobs in which they both applied were very different in scope. The job that was provided here has much more emphasis on the development side of websites and web applications. This has some significant impacts on the kind of work being done along with the programming languages being used to achieve the desired results. Due to the heavy emphasis on web development this is yet another separate category of IT to be explored</p></br>
    <p>Timothy Prast showed interest in the business analyst line of work. This was another position advertised in the public sector which created some interesting criteria. There was a need to be able to follow planning protocols called SCRUM, this is a methodology where a bigger problem is broken down into smaller steps, these small parts are worked on and the problem is analysed and broken down again. Upon analysis of this job it seems to differ significantly to many others within the IT industry, and thus it paints a very large picture about the size of this industry.</p></br>
