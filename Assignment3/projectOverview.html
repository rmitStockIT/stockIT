    <h2>Project Plan</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="blue">
    <h3>Topic</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
  <p>The application stockIT will require a significant amount resources to implement a complete product. These resources are not available to our team in regard to the project timeline or our individual skills. In our time frame of five weeks, we will have a fully fleshed out wire-frame including graphical content, we will have a start up site containing a desktop oriented mock site and have a stretch goal of creating an application for android. These developments will show our abilities to work together well within a team environment and achieve measurable success with the resources available.</p></br>
  <p>The wire-frame shows our design implementation and continuity. Using a non functional sketch or three-dimensional plan is one of the best ways to start any serious project. This allows your team to create an application layout quickly showing basic functionality in the form of navigation and design. This allows your team to know what the agreed look for the project will be allowing the team to create the necessary code making the project functional.</p></br>
  <p>Our desktop oriented mock site show the basic functionality required for our project. Our development from wire-frame will make it easy to develop the final deliverable part of our project. This mock site will have basic functionalities allowing any user to add or remove stock from the database, insert new stock items and run a stock take using the supplied database.</p></br>
  <p>This database will be populated with data pulled from the hospitality industry supplied to us from one member of the team. This website allows the team to present a functional part to our project.</p></br>
  <p>Creating an android application is our teams stretch goal. This will be developed right up to the due date to show our intention of creating a meaningful product out of this. This will allow the team countless opportunities to develop skills and knowledge useful in the information technology(IT) industry. Additionally it shows a drive to take away more from this class and earn more than just a passing grade. As this is a significant step up in complexity from creating a mock site or a wire-frame the quality of the product delivered will be indicative of a first years work.</p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
  <p>stockIT was born from a single team member’s desire to fill a perceived gap in the current market of inventory management software. After detailed discussion between all parties we have expanded the initial stock-taking application to a full inventory management system. This change occurred due to the increased future potential of a full inventory system rather than a stock taking application. A project such as this allows our team to provide an exposé based upon our skills both individually and also when working together as a team.</p></br>
  <p>As a development project stockIT covers a lot of knowledge and skill bases within the IT industry that we as a group would like to develop further. At its end point the software will require a working knowledge of various programming languages (SQL, XML, C++, Java etc), networking, user interface development (websites, apps, software design), project management and teamwork, cloud infrastructure, software integration and artificial intelligence(AI) implementation. The software taps into many different aspects of the IT industry and intersects with many of our planned future career paths. This is why a team we decided it would be a worthwhile project to pursue.</p></br>
  <p>Our team views stockIT as a start-up. Start-ups have always been a defining factor of the IT industry, whereby a group of individuals unite to create a piece of software or to solve a problem using IT technologies. We believe stockIT achieves both of these things as it uses a tech-based approach to solve a problem that affects every business that buys or sells inventory on some level. A big development within the IT industry over the past decade has been in the use and development of AI technology. As stockIT is centered around handling and making sense of large amounts of data, we believe that AI integration is an important part to the software’s utility and marketability. AI technology is at the cutting edge of the IT industry and from it has spawned many new fields of study and different career paths.</p>

  <h3>Landscape</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
  <p>Inventory management software is a somewhat crowded marketplace. As with most software markets there are a variety of competing products that all provide very similar services but that all have their own delineations that set them apart. stockIT straddles the line between pure inventory management software and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, placing it into a market with large established companies such as MYOB and XERO. MYOB and XERO have established accounting software systems that integrate into a range of existing Point of Sale (PoS) systems. The plan aim is for stockIT to have similar integration, in this situation MYOB focusses on being more of an enterprise resource planning software solution and XERO focusses on the accounting integration side of things. StockIT will have a heavier focus on direct supplier integration and communication than either of these.</p></br>
  <p>Cin7 is designed to be more of a retail inventory solution with a strong leaning towards online retail whereas Peach Software has a strong focus on more traditional retail (agriculture businesses, auto parts etc) and managing inventories between stores and across the group. In this situation, stockIT is designed to operate as a one stop shop by facilitating all these different functionalities into the one software bundle. Oracle Netsuite is one of the closest competitors to the finalized version of stockIT, with real time inventory visibility, direct supplier purchasing available and the ability to push purchase orders directly to shipment and sales tracking – all of which will be available through stockIT. Katana offers robust manufacturing inventory management, live tracking with real-time manufacturing planning and end to end traceability. This makes Katana a slight outlier on the list as it leans towards the manufacturing process and handling the data related to that area. While this is something that stockIT does handle, our product is designed more and an inventory management tool rather than a direct Manufacturing tie-in.</p>
